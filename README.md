# Spec

Using Vue, display all numbers from 1 to 100 in a random order on the screen. This number should be configurable via a provided input box. If the user places their pointer over a given number, highlight that numbers' divisors. For example, if the user hovers over 21, the numbers 1, 3, 7 would be highlighted. 22 would highlight 1, 2 and 11.
